# Limebot

Limebot is a Discord bot used on the [Limey V1](https://limey-discord.onrender.com) Discord server.

This bot is very specialised for the Limey V1 server and its community, so it might not be very useful for other servers.

Nevertheless it is still available under a free software license so you can easily audit and modify it!

## Setup

Prequisites: git, nodejs, pnpm

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `assets/examples/config.example.ts` to `src/config.ts` and fill in all values. Many modules can be disabled via their `enabled` config value.
    If you disable a module, you don't need to fill in any other config values for it.

## Running

1. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `pnpm start` to start the bot

## Running as a service

1. Copy `assets/examples/limebot.service` to your systemd service directory. Tweak the `WorkingDirectory` value to wherever you cloned the repo.
2. Enable & Start the `limebot` systemd service via `systemctl [--user] enable --now limebot`

## HTTP Server

The bot includes a HTTP server that is used for some modules (namely GitHub linking and the Limey V1 reporter). If you want to enable it,
you also have to set up a reverse proxy to forward traffic to the bot.

I suggest [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). You can find an example Caddyfile in `assets/examples/Caddyfile`. The Caddyfile and `config.ts` file
should have matching domains and port.
